        <h2>El Nido Travel Requirements & <br>Guidelines | COVID-19 New Normal</h2>
        <p>Travelers can once again explore its stunning beaches, majestic lagoons, and other scenic spots. The local government has different requirements for entry for different kinds of tourists, so when planning a trip to this paradise, be sure to check what category you fall under and what your requirements are.</p>


<button class="accordion"><h3>Who are allowed to go to El Nido?</h3></button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>El Nido in Palawan is open to Palawan-based tourists and tourists coming from outside Palawan. Fully vaccinated individuals or those who have received their last dose of their COVID-19 vaccine two weeks prior to their arrival in El Nido can enter, provided they can present a vaccination certificate from vaxcert.doh.gov.ph or a COVID-19 vaccination card.</p>

  <p> Unvaccinated or partially vaccinated tourists need to present a negative COVID-19 test result. For unvaccinated/partially vaccinated tourists coming from Palawan, a negative antigen test result taken within 24 hours from arrival in El Nido is required. Those unvaccinated/partially vaccinated tourists coming from outside Palawan need to secure a negative RT-PCR test result taken within 48 hours from arrival.</p>
   
  <p> Children 11 years old and below shall follow the testing requirements of the parent or guardian traveling with them.</p>
   
 <p  >  All travelers, regardless of origin, must have a confirmed booking at any of the DOT-accredited El Nido hotels and resorts and register via s-pass.ph.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion"><h3>What are the entry points in El Nido?</h3></button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Domestic tourists can enter via a direct flight to El Nido. They may also enter via the other airports in Palawan. Take note that health assessment of visitors is mandatory upon entry in the port and exit at the point of destination.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion"><h3>What travel requirements do you need to prepare?</h3></button>
<div class="panel">
  <h3>Get a vaccination certificate from vaxcert.doh.gov.ph (for fully vaccinated)</h3>
  <p>Fully vaccinated individuals must present a vaccination certificate from vaxcert.doh.gov.ph or a vaccination card.</p>

<h3>Secure a negative COVID-19 test result (for unvaccinated and partially vaccinated)</h3>
<p>Unvaccinated and partially vaccinated travelers from outside the province must show a negative RT-PCR test result taken within 48 hours prior to travel. Unvaccinated and partially vaccinated travelers coming from other areas in Palawan need to present a negative antigen test result taken within 24 hours before their arrival in El Nido.</p>

<h3>Register and get a Travel Permit via S-Pass</h3>
<p>All travelers to El Nido must register and submit their requirements via s-pass.ph. After doing this, they must coordinate via the Municipal Tourism Office of El Nido via their Facebook page, elnidotouristpass@gmail.com, 09190021339, or 09064490282 so they can get their Travel Permit.  </p>

<h3>Confirmed Booking at a DOT-Accredited Accommodation</h3>
<p>Tourists can only stay at DOT-Accredited El Nido resorts and hotels with CAO (Certificate of Authority to Operate).</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion"><h3> What are the guidelines and protocols to follow when you're in El Nido?</h3></button>
<div class="panel">
<h3>Minimum health standards</h3>
<p>Tourists must use face masks, sanitize hands regularly, and practice social distancing, especially in public. This is to help fight the spread of COVID-19.</p>

<h3>Transport protocols</h3>
<p>Private transportation from the point of entry to the accommodation must be secured by tourists. They are allowed to leave their hotel and visit the islands to do some recreational activities like scuba diving or snorkeling as long as it’s part of the El Nido tour packages handled by a DOT-accredited travel agency or tour operator.  </p>
</div>


<button class="accordion"><h3>What to Wear?</h3></button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Pack your breathable summer outfits if you’re planning a trip to El Nido, especially during the dry and summer season. Make sure to bring sun protection like sunglasses, hats, and scarves especially if you’re exploring El Nido on a motorcycle. At night, bring a light jacket or a scarf with you to keep you warm if you’re by the beach.</p>

</div>


<button class="accordion"><h3>Currency</h3></button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Make sure to bring enough cash in Philippine Peso (PHP). There's one ATM in the Town Proper, but there's no assurance that it will be online all the time during your trip. It's best to withdraw or exchange enough money while you're in bigger cities like Manila.</p>
<p>Some establishments like luxury hotels and high-end restaurants, accept credit cards, but again, it's better to bring enough cash. </p>
</div>

<button class="accordion"><h3>Language </h3></button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>The locals of El Nido speak Filipino, Cuyonon, and other varieties of Visayan languages. The majority of locals, especially in tourist areas, can speak and understand basic English. </p>
